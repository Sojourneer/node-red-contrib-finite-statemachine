v1.0.0
(2020-04-30)

Changes / Improvements / Optimisations:
- Ouputs | Changed from 3 to 1 output. See documentation if you used the 2nd or 3rd output before how to get the same function with an rbe node. Additionally added option to always send state.
- Node behaviour "data object" | Added new functionality so that the "data" object can be set within a state of the statemachine (via definition of the transition table). Up to now, the "data" object could only be modified via a JSON message at the input.
